<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">The goal of this project is to predict a male workerâ€™s wage from the Mid-Atlantic region based on his age, marital status, race, education, job class, and year that wage information was recorded.</p>
<h3 class="code-line" data-line-start=3 data-line-end=4 ><a id="Data_3"></a>Data</h3>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">The Wage data was obtained from the Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (ISLR) package in R. It contains 3,000 observations of 11 variables.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">After a response variable and one or more predictor variables are chosen from the menus on the left, each tab performs the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9"><strong>Data Summary:</strong> generates 5-number summaries for each numeric variable and  frequencies for each categorical variable</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="9" data-line-end="10"><strong>Exploratory Plots:</strong> shows univariate plots for each variable</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11"><strong>Variable Selection:</strong>  performs 10-fold cross-validation on the model designated by the user and plots the mean cross-validation error as a function of model size; allows the user to select the number of variables to include in the final model based on the plot; shows the coefficients of the best subsets model for the chosen number of variables</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="11" data-line-end="12"><strong>Confidence Intervals:</strong> calculates 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for each coefficient of the model obtained after performing variable selection</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="14"><strong>Prediction Interval:</strong> calculates a 95% prediction interval for a new observation, which is designated as the median of each predictor (performed after variable selection and confidence intervals)</li>
</ul>
